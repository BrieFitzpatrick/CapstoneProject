					<li>What do you know now about your abortion experience that you would tell a younger version of yourself?</li>
					<li>Were there barriers you faced? How did you navigate them?</li>
					<li>How did you pay for your abortion? If you had insurance, were you able to use it, why or why not? Did you have to borrow money from someone or call an abortion fund? How did that experience make you feel?</li>
					<li>Was there someone who helped you navigate barriers? How did they help you? What stands out about that person to you?</li>
